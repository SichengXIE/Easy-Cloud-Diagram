# Word Cloud Generator for YouTuber Types and Fan Counts

This Python script generates a visually appealing word cloud based on YouTuber types and their corresponding fan counts. Users can input a list of YouTuber types and fan counts, and the script will create a word cloud image using the wordcloud library and display it using matplotlib.pyplot.

## Example

1. Enter the YouTuber types when prompted. Separate the types by commas.
2. Enter the corresponding fan counts when prompted. Separate the counts by commas.

</pre>

## Notes
1. The script uses a system font for the word cloud display.
2. The WordCloud is generated with specific parameters, including width, height, background color, font path, and colormap.
3. The resulting word cloud image is displayed using matplotlib.pyplot.
4. The image is saved to the specified file path or the default path if not provided.
